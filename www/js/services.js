      "description": "<p><b>TNA Impact Wrestling TV taping<br />London, England at SSE Arena Wembley<br />Report by Dot Net staffer Haydn Gleed</b></p>\n<p>As they took down the cage for the next taping, Dixie Carter came out and thanked the fans for all the fantastic support. The crowd chanted \"Thank You, Dixie.\" She said she had a surprise and introduced Billy Corgan. He asked if the crowd was having a good time. One guy near the ramp was jumping up and down like this was the greatest moment of his life...</p>\n<p><b>1. The Wolves defeated Mandrews and Will Ospreay to retain the TNA Tag Titles.</b> Mandrews made his skateboard entrance with will Osprey, a great reaction for the Cardiff boy. The Wolves made their entrance with the tag titles. They were wearing British inspired paint on the chest. A great back and for from all four men with some excellent spots. The action slowed down with The Wolves on offense with quick tags isolating Ospreay. Mandrews got the hot tag and came in with a huracarana, but something went wrong and he laid motionless on the mat for a good 20 seconds. The ref held up the X sign. Mandrews tried to get to his feet but was unsteady and just managed to tag in Ospreay. After some back and forth, The Wolves won the match via pin fall. After the match, the medical team came rushing out for Mandrews (why they didn't come out before I don't know and, no, it didn't look like a worked injury as you could see the wrestlers talking and improvising spots). The Wolves rushed over to check on Mandrews and helped him up and took him to the back. This had the potential to be a great match, but the injury derailed it somewhat...</p>\n<p><b>2. Abyss (Crazzy Steve, Goth Girl) beat Jimmy Havoc in a Monster's Ball match.</b> Both men brawled early, standard Monster Ball style. Abyss introduced the cheese grater early but Havoc took it and raked quite hard against Abyss's, um, little Joseph Park. Jimmy climbed to the top rope, but crazy Steve distracted him and Abyss pushed him off the top rope through the table. Abyss introduced Janice, who, of course, missed when he tried to use it and went through a table. Jimmy introduced a barbed wire board into the match. He struck Abyss a couple of times across the head with a kendo stick and went for the killer blow, but Abyss picked him up and hit a Black Hole Slam on Havoc through the barbed wire board. With Marilyn Manson playing, they stood over Jimmy. After the match local boy Havoc got a great reaction. A fun Monster's Ball with semi dangerous but safe stunts...</p>\n<p>Josh Matthews was introduced as he was doing commentary backstage. He kissed up to the fans and said that London was louder than Manchester at the tapings last night...</p>\n<p><b>3. Mike Bennett (w/Maria) defeated Drew Galloway.</b> Maria came out and told us that the UK is broken but she believes in miracles. With that Mike Bennett came out to little reaction. On the flip side, Drew Galloway made his entrance to a huge reaction. Bennett tried to run away but Galloway caught him and stomped him in the corner. Maria tried and failed to distract drew but he hit a big boot to Bennett. The action spilled to the outside where some fans held Bennett open out wide for Drew to chop him.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Bennett gained the advantage but got thrown into the ring post by the man from Scotland. The action spilled back into the ring and Bennett gained control. The match slowed down with Bennett keeping Drew on the mat. Drew eventually came back with head butts and a flying clothesline from the top rope. Late in the match, Galloway stomped in the corner and hit a big drop kick. Galloway applied a submission but Maria put Bennett's foot on the rope. Bennett snuck up behind Galloway and rolled him up for a three count.....</p>\n<p>Earl Hebner was introduced and asked his thoughts on the fans in London. He said they were great and then walked back up the ramp....ok.....</p>\n<p><b>4. Eric Young defeated Damo O'Connor to retain the King of the Mountain Title.</b> Young had an open challenge for the King of the Mountain Title. Young won via piledriver...</p>\n<p><b>5. Kurt Angle beat Bobby Roode.</b> Roode made his entrance alone. Angle came out to the biggest pop of the night. He gestured to the whole crowd, and the match was on. Both men felt each other out to begin with with a cagey start. Angle got the better of the early exchanges. The crowd chanted \"We love you, Angle, we do.\" Roode was kept on the mat in the early going of the match but Roode came back a knee to the mid section. It was Angle's turn to be kept on the mat. Angle got to his feet and both men charged at each other and hit a double clothesline. Angle got to his feet first but Roode came back with a spinebuster.</p>\n<p>Roode climbed to the top but missed with his attempt. Angle his three back suplexes in a row for a great reaction. Angle applied the ankle lock, but Roode escaped and threw Kurt shoulder first into the ring post. Roode applied a crossface, which Angle reversed into an ankle lock but Roode reversed as well back into the crossface. After breaking the hold, Angle charged at Roode, only to be put back into a crossface. Angle broke the hold and hit an Olympic slam on Roode for a close two count. Late in the match Angle locked in the ankle lock, but this time laid it in fully and got the submission victory....</p>\n<p>After the match, both men hugged mid ring. Roode made a beautiful speech and Angle cried. The crowd chanted \"thank you, Angle.\" James Storm came down the ramp and got in the ring. He said all he wants to say is thank you to a TNA legend. He said to him his friendship is priceless. Beer Money opened beers and Kurt said no, so they pulled some milk out. Funny. Kurt poured the milk with most of it going all over him.</p>\n<p>The Wolves came out to join in the celebration. They said some nice things about Angle. They also built up the match for The Wolves against Beer Money which will be tapped at the tapings on Sunday. I don't know when the show will end as far as television is concerned, but this was a beautiful, genuine moment that Kurt was obviously touched by....</p>\n<p><i>We are looking for correspondents for all WWE, NXT, TNA, ROH, Evolve, and GFW live events.

      "description": "<p>By Jake Barnett </p>\n<p><h3><strong>WWE Smackdown Hits</strong></h3><br /><strong>AJ Styles:</strong> A solid debut on Smackdown for Styles, and we got to see the first Styles Clash in WWE. It's a bit odd that WWE didn't hype the appearance ahead of time, but the crowd seemed thrilled to see him regardless. I'm a big believer in AJ's potential in WWE, and it's nice that creative seems to be doing him a favor by having him wrestle and show off what he can do in the ring prior to having him involved in a dramatic confrontation on the microphone. He is much better in the ring than he is in the microphone, and placing him in a long form story right away would have placed the wrong foot forward.</p>\n<p><strong>Kalisto vs. Neville:</strong> These two had an enjoyable US Championship match. I'll echo the complaint from Jason Powell's live coverage of this show and say that WWE seems to have no idea what they are doing with Kalisto the Champion as of yet. This match wasn't announced prior to the show and had no promo time for Kalisto, which is notable since he has multiple opportunities to speak during his feud with Alberto Del Rio. The match itself was good and offered a lot in the form of acrobatics as you would expect. If WWE can find a direction for the US Championship, even if it's open challenges to give some structure, it would add quite a lot to Kalisto and the title picture.</p>\n<p><strong>Highlight Reel:</strong> I enjoyed the Reigns and Ambrose interactions during the Highlight Reel. They have a great chemistry together that draws better performances out of Reigns that we've seen from any other opponent.<br /><h3><strong>WWE Smackdown Misses</strong></h3><br /><strong>The Wyatt Family:</strong> The Wyatt portion of the Highlight Reel segment was a bust for me. How many times do we have to hear Bray Wyatt make some threat that will never be carried out? Why does he insist on insinuating that he's going to take over the world and make people disappear forever? I have a feeling that WWE's excuse for this is that he's crazy and delusion, but other \"crazy\" characters don't aren't booked this way and it's to the point where his opponents rarely treat him as anything but a poorly told joke. The most capable Wyatt ever felt was immediately after he defeated Daniel Bryan at the Royal Rumble 2014. He's had some up's and downs in between then and now, but for the most part the state of his credibility has been steadily declining. I'm not sure how you make him feel like anything but a paper tiger heading into a matchup with Lesnar.</p>\n<p><strong>Opening Segment:</strong> Nobody in particular performed poorly in the opening segment, but how boring is it to have every Smackdown start with New Day or whoever their opponent for the night is talking themselves into a 6 or 8 man tag match for later in the show?</p>\n<p><strong>Natalya vs. Charlotte:</strong> Their encounter in NXT is one of the matches that ignited people's interest in the women's division, and they didn't get a chance to show off much of that here. The finish was inexcusable, with Ric Flair simply wooing in Natalya's face and causing a distraction that led to the submission. Does Koko B. Ware have a daughter? I think with a little bit of effort from the birdman they could lock down the Divas division with distraction roll-ups.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Man Matches:</strong> Every week, it seems like we get at least two matches with six or more competitors on Smackdown, and the formula for the matches are practically identical. It's a crutch that WWE relies on far too heavily to kill time on their broadcasts and it has run much of the fun of those matches right into the ground.</p>",

      "description": "<p><b>TNA Impact Wrestling TV taping<br />London, England at SSE Arena Wembley<br />Report by Dot Net staffer Haydn Gleed</b></p>\n<p>Unlike the NXT event last month, one side of the arena was blocked off. The areas that were available were filled up nicely with an expectant crowd.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Borash came out to a good ovation and high fives the fans at ringside. He geared up the crowd well. He announced that EC3 would get his rematch tonight, and they showed a video of EC3 talking from home. He said he realizes that sometimes he's been a piece of shit. He said he's done all that because he's addicted to wrestling. I'm guessing this is the video that will air this week on Impact. The crowd got restless during it and started woooo'ing which was a shame as it was a good promo.</p>\n<p><b>1. James Storm and Bobby Roode beat Eric Young and Bram in a cage match.</b> Storm came down on a motorized beer cart (nice). The action started outside the ring outside the cage and continued like that for a good five minutes. Eventually with Storm selling a Bram DDT on the outside, Bram and Young had Roode alone in the cage with the door shut. There were some nice near falls during the match before Beer Money got the victory. Despite some sloppy spots, lots of crowd pleasing moments and got the tapings off to a good start...</p>\n<p>EC3 came out next to a mixed reaction, but was certainly playing a babyface by high-fiving the fans at ringside. He sat on the ring steps with a microphone. He said what better place to fight than in London. He said the steel structure separates the man from the boys. He took some fun verbal shots at Reby before promoting the title match later tonight. He stood mid-ring and called out Rockstar Spud, who came out wearing an awesome multicolored suit.</p>\n<p>Once in the ring EC3 talked about their match last year and reminded him that he told him he had the biggest heart in the world. He offered Spud his hand. With the crowd cheering, Spud accepted. Spud said he did what he did last week because it's the right thing. He said Matt Hardy is rotten to the core and he had the nerve to tell him what to do. He screamed that no one tells him what to do. He was infuriated by Hardy.</p>\n<p>Matt Hardy screamed that the ring and the arena is his. The crowd were trying to be smart arses by chanting \"We Want Jeff\" so I couldn't hear most of his promo. He concluded by telling EC3 that he will beat him tonight. Great stuff from all three men and it turned the crowd completley in favor of EC3...</p>\n<p><b>2. Trevor Lee (w/Shane Helms) beat Tigre Uno in a cage match to retain the X Division Title.</b> Tigre came out with heavy strapping on his shoulder. Helms introduced himself as the star power and Trevor Lee as the horsepower. He has the worst intro music I've ever heard. Lee busted open up his mouth early in the match. Tigre Uno came off the top of the cage with a crossbody, which caused someone behind me to scream just escape. Sure enough, Lee came back and won the match...</p>\n<p>After the previous match, they brought out all kinds of weapons and hung them up on the cage for the first ever Knockouts Lethal Lockdown. I didn't have high hopes for this. JB announced that Madison Rayne had been taken out by the dollhouse, so Gail Kim and Velvet sky would have to find a third partner. Jade from the Dollhouse made her entrance to no reaction followed by Gail Kim to a great reaction...</p>\n<p><b>3. Jade, Marti Bell, and Rebel beat Gail Kim, Velvet Sky, and Maria in a Lethal Lockdown match.</b> Jade went for a weapon first but was cut off. Some idiot obnoxious fans behind me shouted kiss. Marti Bell came out as the next entrant. She beat down Kim for a while. Pretty quickly Velvet Sky was introduced as the next entrant and gained the advantage on both heels. No weapons used so far. Rebel entered and knocked down both Kim and Sky. Rebel grabbed the baking tray ad smashed Kim in the head (Kim did get her hand up to block).</p>\n<p>The surprise entrant for Kim and Sky was Maria, who ran to the ring teased climbing in the ring. However, with a smile she locked the door and mocked Kim. The Dollhouse chocked out Kim and Sky before hitting them with kendo sticks. The heels beat down the babyfaces but Kim and Sky came back and managed to get the upper hand. The crowd chanted this awesome, I couldn't disagree with them more. The ending of the match came when Jade hit a pretty neat pile driver type maneuver. That was the only positive I can say for the match, which brutal and not in a good way despite the obvious effort put in by the five women. As Velvet walked up and he ramp, it looked like some fan pissed off Sky as she started jawing at an area of the crowd...</p>\n<p>Kurt Angle came out to a thunderous and standing ovation. It was a stunning moment. He climbed in the ring and looked genuinely touched. He said this is his farewell tour, and he couldn't be happier to have it anywhere than in the UK. He mentioned the match last year against Lashley, which brought the man himself out. Lashley climbed in the ring and said he can't believe he is out here bragging about beating him, but like he told him he's going to get revenge. He said he did that to motivate him and they would have one more match and he would get the revenge that he wants. Angle said he came out to talk to the fans but now he's pissed off. He challenged him to a match on the spot. Lashley said carry on talking to your fans, our time will come, and with that he walked out of the ring. A surprisingly good promo by Lashley...</p>\n<p><b>4. Odarg beat Eli Drake in a cage match.</b> Drake grabbed a microphone and said Grado was fired so why is he running around with a mask calling himself Odarg. With that \"Like a Prayer\" played and the crowd exploded. Odarg climbed in the ring and was attacked by Eli Drake. Odarg tried to climb out of the ring but couldn't reach the top and moved when Drake went for a punch. Eventually, Drake low blowed him. This led to Drake throwing Odarg around and against the steel cage. The end of the match came when Eli's trunks where pulled slightly down exposing his rear end and Odarg hit a running somersault in the corner. Odarg climbed the cage and both men fought on top. Odarg went to drop down but as he did Drake grabbed his mask exposing him as Grado. Odarg ran to the back with a towel over his head. Fun but slightly silly match...</p>\n<p>They announced that TNA is opening a wrestling school in London...</p>\n<p><b>5. Matt Hardy (w/Tyrus) beat EC3 in a cage match to retain the TNA Title.</b> EC3 came out to another great reaction, the fans have accepted the turn. The singing of his theme song has been the loudest thing on this taping outside of Angle. Hardy came out with Tyrus but without Reby. Matt climbed on the apron and jawed at EC3 and shared some words with Tyrus. The cage door closed and both men stood facing each other. They exchanged punches but Hardy got the early advantage. EC3 came back with multiple chops. Tyrus threw a chair in the ring, which Matt used to his advantage and had full control of the match until EC3 threw Matt head first into a chair setup in the corner.</p>\n<p>At one point in the match, EC3 tried to walk out the door but Tyrus blocked his path. He called Tyrus in the ring and beat him down. Tyrus though eventually came back and knocked EC3 to the mat. He picked up a chain and chained EC3 to the ropes, however EC3 reversed it and got Tyrus chained in the ropes. With this distraction, Hardy snuck up from behind and hit a Twist of Fate for a near near near fall. Matt attempted to climb the cage but EC3 suplexed him off the cage.</p>\n<p>Late in the match, EC3 low blowed Hardy, and the crowd got behind the former champion. Reby came down to the ring with a hammer, but Rockstar Spud ran down and took the hammer and threw it away. He opened the door for EC3 but then slammed it in his head. He helped Matt climb out of the cage to retain the title. The crowd chanted you sold out at Spud as he stood over EC3 with a chair and hit him in the head. Spud, Matt and Reby celebrated to finish the taping for the first show.</p>\n<p><i>We are looking for correspondents for all WWE, NXT, TNA, ROH, Evolve, and GFW live events.

      "description": "<p><b>The Two Man Power Trip of Wrestling Podcast with Mike Quackenbush<br />Hosts: John and Chad<br />Interview available at <a href=\"http://tmptow.podomatic.com/entry/2016-01-28T21_00_00-08_00\" target=\"_blank\">Tmptow.podomatic.com</a></b></p>\n<p><b>Looking back at CHIKARA'S growth and how things have progressed for the company:</b> It's like a blur. I can relate to this now as a father and it's kind of like, one day you turn around and you think and look at your kids and say when did they grow up? I feel a little bit about that with CHIKARA. In the early years you don't have time to sit down and reflect about it and realize well these three years have gone quick or these six years have gone quick you are just trying to stay alive and you are trying to keep your head above water. But every once and again you do have cause to kind of sit back and look over your shoulder and say man the years have really gone here. Maybe that is fresh on my mind right now sensing that our training facility The Wrestle Factory and knowing how many Wrestle Factory graduates are about to in this calendar year before 2016 is over are about to ascend onto the roster. There is going to be this inevitable changing of the guard and that's one of those touchstones that really started when one of the longest standing CHIKARA guys Ultra Mantis Black had a career ending injury after a crazy, dumb accident in the ring that some of these guys that have been with me since day one are really in that position where some of them are getting past that age where the WWE wouldn't even look at them but that was their aspiration, they wouldn't even pass the cut off in terms of their age and that inevitability that life is going to creep up on you. But I sense this changing of the guard and this really has made me look back on it and say what a crazy trip it has been thus far.</p>\n<p><b>Building the loyal fan base of CHIKARA and continuing to grow it:</b> It never ceases to amaze me. For example, two of our fans named their daughter CHIKARA or every time I hear a weird story like that or some fan comes up and shows me they've got a sleeve on their arm of all the CHIKARA characters tattooed on them or that we ship an order out to Guam. It boggles my mind and part of it is as you guys know, when I was coming up, the internet was scarce or a handful of people that had access to the internet regularly and the kind of explosion of AOL chat rooms and people that had home computers and weren't paying by the minute for access to where we are now and the ubiquity of the internet that someone could lift up their phone right now and be live and Periscope an entire CHIKARA event to the world. It boggles my mind.</p>\n<p><b>The creation of CHIKARA and nearly naming the company Impact Wrestling:</b> It's strange to think about this now but we started talking about it in the Summer of 2000. This precedes the creation of NWA-TNA. We were talking about it and Tom (Carter AKA Reckless Youth) and I as well as Don Montoya who was one of our traveling mates. We decided after Tom came back from his WWF Developmental deal and I feel like when Tom came back they had beaten a lot of his passion for the craft out of him and I think that is a reoccurring struggle for everyone, self-included that I go through this like once a year where you are utterly burned out by what we do and you must be able to find the joy for your craft again. We kind of just decided that all we do is moan about how awful things are, shouldn't we SHUT UP and do something and we decided yes, we are going to change things. We are going to do it by training people in a certain kind of way, we want a more cosmopolitan style that involves all of these International things and we originally wanted to call it Impact Wrestling and for quite a while maybe about four or five months it was Impact Wrestling and then when the time came and we were going to put up a fairly small sum of money, I mean it was a significant in reality for guys in their 20s and well at that point Montoya bowed out. So then it became Tom and I and when Montoya bowed out we decided we are not going to keep this name because that was for the three of us so it needs to be something else.</p>\n<p><i>For the entire story about CHIKARA'S launch please listen to the full interview as well as Quacks comments about the popularity of The King of Trios, the creativity behind the CHIKARA characters, highlights of his in ring career and much more.</i></p>",

Mike Johnson of <a href=\"http://pwinsider.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PWInsider.com</a> reports that Kong threw Hardy's bags out of the locker room and would not let her dress there due to previous issues between the two. The situation escalated and TNA officials reportedly made the call to send Kong home.</p>\n<p><b><u>Powell's POV:</b></u> Well, that's one way to start an overseas tour.
